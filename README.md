# UKC-BookExchange


This is an Android application I worked on as part of a group for my 
final year University project.
The purpose of the App is to be used as a platform for students to buy
and sell second hand books.

App features: 
  - ISBN scanner to allow users to scan the ISBN barcode of a book and 
   retrieve its information by performing an HTTP request to the google books API
  - Content based filtering algorithm implementation to provide personalisation
  to the users feed based on their preference
  - In App chat to allow users to exchange contact information and a search.

The UI was developed entirely using the android SDK.

This was my first fully working Android App. Please, any suggestions with regards to the code and the implementation of the 
features are welcome.
